                        <p>Fifty years after we first met as teenagers in our first year at GHS, we have travelled the world and explored our surroundings confident in our own skins. It has not been possible to hear from everybody, but we have definitely caught up with many. While some have been comfortable with sharing a bit of themselves, others will definitely enjoy reading what has been shared. We are hoping that this introduction will give you a glimpse of the ethos of the ladies that joined Gayaza High School in February 1974 and the ladies that joined them along the way.

                            Gayaza, was where I made two life changing decisions that pitched a shy insecure teenager into leadership and eventually into the call into the priesthood. It was in Gayaza I encountered the God of love who totally transformed my outlook on   life, on my value and my purpose. It is also in Gayaza while I served as assistant Chaplain that I heard the call to the ordained ministry.<p>

Dad introduced his family and handed her my proof of scholarship from the Western Region which I had won. Miss Warren  received us warmly and congratulated me upon this achievement. I could see my Dad beam with pride. <p>

Coming from a rural area where my parents had trained me very well in any house chores and gardening, I was good at any housework I was given. In fact, I tried to help and teach the town girls how to peel matooke and do the house chores.<p>

However, the honour of dining with Miss Warren Sheila in her home for my first supper in Gayaza remains a wonderful memory for me. It was my first time speaking with a white person one-on-one.<p>

                            I had my first encounter with a Muzungu (a white person) three days after reporting to <em>“The School”</em>. I met Miss S Warren (MHSRIP), just near the Chapel, who greeted me: <em>“How are you, Miss?”</em>. I happily responded with confidence: <strong>“I am fine, thank you. How are you madam?”</strong>. Oh my God, she shouted back: <em>“I am not a madam. I do not sell tomatoes in the market-..."</em>. Apparently, <em>"Madam"</em> is used when you do not know the person. Scary, but unforgettable! Since then, I am very selective in the “terms” or “words” I use in my communication―<p>

                            A- level in Gayaza was a special time for me. Getting the opportunity to put on that green skirt was a great achievement. HSC at Gayaza was special time. You move to a room shared by two people or sometimes got a single room if you were a prefect. I was the house prefect for Kennedy House. This pushed you to work hard because prefects were never expected to fail! I remember us walking on the pavements and the O level students had to make way for the HSCs to pass! The rest for seniority was obvious and expected. This groomed us to respect social order.<p>

A root system that takes five years to develop in order to support the twenty-five-metre plant that is called the Chinese bamboo. The enabler I needed to pursue my childhood dream of becoming an Engineer. It has served me well as a maama musumba/ma moruti/padre’s wife/ma mfundisi; a calling that has given me the opportunity to live and work with different groups of people, comfortable in the leadership role that comes with the territory.<p>

We stood tall and fearless in front of our competitors from schools such as Mt. St.Mary's College Namagunga- regardless of the outcome of the Table Tennis games.<p>

Alot of comfort came from the fact that soon, I would see my sister Cissy walk towards me and my parents. And she did!!

                            I saw Ms. Cutler our physical education /gym teacher walking towards where I was squatting.
                            Hyde, her dog found me. She sniffed at me, I think she understood because she stood still and did not bark at me. 
                            Unfortunately, Hyde refused to respond to Ms. Cutler’s call. This led Ms. Cutler to order me to come out of the hedge.....</p>

                            An enduring memory of GHS (Senior) was “the talk” with Ms. Warren in my first week. 
                            During” the talk” Ms. Warren asked me what I wanted to be eventually, I replied, “a medical doctor”. 
                            I nearly fell out of the chair when Ms. Warren said, “like your sister Samalie”
                            I was amazed and flattered. I marvelled at her knowing such a detail about my sister who had been in a large class and had completed A’ Levels at GHS in 1968. 
                            I left the meeting feeling very special.
