It has not been possible to hear from everybody, but we have definitely caught up with many. While some have been comfortable with sharing a bit of themselves, others will definitely enjoy reading what has been shared. The hope is that these extracts will provide a glimpse of the ethos of the ladies that joined Gayaza High School in February 1974 and the ladies that joined them along the way.

                            Gayaza, was where I made two life changing decisions that pitched a shy insecure teenager into leadership and eventually into the call into the priesthood. It was in Gayaza I encountered the God of love who totally transformed my outlook on   life, on my value and my purpose. It is also in Gayaza while I served as assistant Chaplain that I heard the call to the ordained ministry.<p>

Dad introduced his family and handed her my proof of scholarship from the Western Region which I had won. Miss Warren  received us warmly and congratulated me upon this achievement. I could see my Dad beam with pride. <p>

Coming from a rural area where my parents had trained me very well in any house chores and gardening, I was good at any housework I was given. In fact, I tried to help and teach the town girls how to peel matooke and do the house chores.<p>

However, the honour of dining with Miss Warren Sheila in her home for my first supper in Gayaza remains a wonderful memory for me. It was my first time speaking with a white person one-on-one.<p>

There I was sharing a decker and a cubical to mention but a few of the things that threw my dreams through the window! I was not free after all- everything was programmed and deviation from the norm had consequences.<p>

                            I had my first encounter with a Muzungu (a white person) three days after reporting to <em>“The School”</em>. I met Miss S Warren (MHSRIP), just near the Chapel, who greeted me: <em>“How are you, Miss?”</em>. I happily responded with confidence: <strong>“I am fine, thank you. How are you madam?”</strong>. Oh my God, she shouted back: <em>“I am not a madam. I do not sell tomatoes in the market-..."</em>. Apparently, <em>"Madam"</em> is used when you do not know the person. Scary, but unforgettable! Since then, I am very selective in the “terms” or “words” I use in my communication―<p>

                            A- level in Gayaza was a special time for me. Getting the opportunity to put on that green skirt was a great achievement. HSC at Gayaza was special time. You move to a room shared by two people or sometimes got a single room if you were a prefect. I was the house prefect for Kennedy House. This pushed you to work hard because prefects were never expected to fail! I remember us walking on the pavements and the O level students had to make way for the HSCs to pass! The rest for seniority was obvious and expected. This groomed us to respect social order.<p>

The enabler I needed to pursue my childhood dream of becoming an Engineer. It has served me well as a maama musumba/ma moruti/padre’s wife/ma mfundisi; a calling that has given me the opportunity to live and work with different groups of people, comfortable in the leadership role that comes with the territory.<p>

                            Under the patronage of Ms Cutler, our Physical Education (PE) teacher for all our GHS life of up to 6 years; the GHS motto was and is magical. I belonged to the Table Tennis (TT) club of champions of GHS 74. Our Ms Cutler wholeheartedly believed in us, determinedly sharpened our TT skills, pushed us hard... We stood tall and fearless in front of our competitors from schools such as Mt. St.Mary's College Namagunga- regardless of the outcome of the Table Tennis games.<p>

Even as I settled in a new school in Kenya, I maintained the principles that Gayaza High School instilled in me - honesty, integrity, and passion in all my endeavour<p>

But the seed was planted. God grew the seed and it has flourished into a beautiful plant. He continues to prune, trim and add fertilizer and I’m serving Him in whatever area he guides me to.<p>

                                Cissy was known for speaking Lusoga to whoever spoke Luganda to her – and I followed suit… – when I first walked through the gate into Gayaza High School in 1974, I was received by smiling Senior 2 students. Alot of comfort came from the fact that soon, I would see my sister Cissy walk towards me and my parents. And she did!!
